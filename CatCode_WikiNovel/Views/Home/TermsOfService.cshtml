When we find these sites we do our best to have them shutdown. In order to act on behalf of our users we need to have your legal permission to do that so we ask for it here when you sign up. You authorize us to act as your agent to issue take down notices under the DMCA and/or any other similar legislation that allows for the submission of requests to Internet service providers and any other person involved in the illegal posting for the removal of infringing or allegedly infringing copyright materials that are contained in or displayed on such service providers platforms and/or services.</p><a class="back-to-top mobile">Back to top</a></div></div><div id="dos-and-donts"><div class="content-block"><span class="back-to-top desktop">Back to top</span><h2 class="subtitle">Things You Should and Shouldn’t Do</h2><p>Millions of people use the TruyenFree platform.
